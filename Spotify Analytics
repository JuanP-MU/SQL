-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle. Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 


SELECT*FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

--What are the three longest songs
SELECT artist_name, track_name,duration_ms as time From BIT_DB.Spotifydata order by time DESC limit 3;

--how many artist had songs with popularity 90 or greater?
Select count(id) as 'artist with  popularity of 90 and above' from BIT_DB.spotifydata  where popularity =90 or popularity >90 ;

-- what were thge top 5 most dance to songs?
SELECT track_name, danceability from BIT_DB.spotifydata order by danceability DESC limit 5;

-- what are the 3 highiest energy tracks?
SELECT track_name,energy from BIT_DB.spotifydata order by energy DESC limit 3;
